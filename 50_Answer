// 50. Explain the concept of equilibrium index and its applications in array problems.

// Answer:
// An equilibrium index in an array is an index where the sum of elements on the left side is equal to the sum of elements on the right side.
// Applications include:
// - Balance point in arrays
// - Equal division of resources or load in distributed systems
// Algorithm: Iterate through the array calculating left and right sums at each index and comparing them.
