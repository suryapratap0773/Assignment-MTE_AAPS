## Problem Statements and Solutions

### 1. **Prefix Sum Array**
**Problem Statement:**
- Explain the concept of a prefix sum array and its applications.
- Write a program to find the sum of elements in a given range [L, R] using a prefix sum array.

**Solution:**
- The solution includes code that implements the prefix sum array technique and shows how it can be used to efficiently calculate the sum of elements in a range.

---

### 2. **Equilibrium Index**
**Problem Statement:**
- Solve the problem of finding the equilibrium index in an array.

**Solution:**
- The equilibrium index is an index where the sum of elements on the left is equal to the sum of elements on the right.
- The solution demonstrates how to find such an index in linear time.

---

### 3. **Longest Palindromic Substring**
**Problem Statement:**
- Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.

**Solution:**
- A solution is implemented that uses the center-expansion technique to efficiently find the longest palindromic substring in the given input string.

---

### 4. **Next Permutation**
**Problem Statement:**
- Solve the problem of finding the next permutation of a given array.

**Solution:**
- This solution explains how to find the next lexicographically greater permutation of an array of integers in-place.

---

### 5. **Intersection of Two Linked Lists**
**Problem Statement:**
- How to find the intersection of two singly linked lists.

**Solution:**
- The solution includes an algorithm that efficiently finds the intersection point of two linked lists using two-pointer technique.

---

### 6. **And More...**
- The repository contains solutions for other problems including:
    - Sliding Window technique
    - Maximum subarray sum using Kadaneâ€™s algorithm
    - Majority element in an array
    - Find the median of two sorted arrays
