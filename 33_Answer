// 33. Explain the sliding window technique and its applications in array problems.

// Answer:
// The sliding window technique optimizes nested loops into a single loop by maintaining a window of elements.
// Applications include finding maximum/minimum/average/sum of subarrays, longest substring without repeating characters, etc.
// It reduces time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).
